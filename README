This is, primarily, an experiment in Django, as well as Python and HTML/CSS, based on no experience in any of the above. The code may be messy but I'm going for functionality over beauty on this one. So far, I've got the basic site up and running (if the local development server counts) and it does the main things I wanted, which is cool. Recently forayed into the world of HTML and CSS to make the front end look halfway presentable, as long as attractiveness is proportional to number of colors used. Next goal is to find a way to get it up online somehow. And maybe add a user interface for adding courses so it doesn't have to be done through admin. Here's a (fairly incomprehensible)  blurb on what the app itself does: 

This is a Django application designed to be a central location for friends to keep track of each other's course schedules. It currently allows for entry of course, user, and enrollment information through the admin site and then presents the information in several forms: a course listing, daily schedules, and a feature displaying who is currently in class.
